# Binding-of-Isaac-Repentance-Run-Randomizer

This is a Python application utilizing Tkinter to provide the user with a random playable Binding of Isaac character (updated to Repentance).

The user can select their own "playlist" of characters, so users can currate their list of characters to choose from.

Run app.py to use the application.
